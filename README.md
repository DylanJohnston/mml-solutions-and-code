## Contents of repository 

(Eventual) full handwritten solutions to the exercises from Part I (Mathematical Foundations).

Part I consists of chapters:
- Chapter 2: Linear Algebra
- Chapter 3: Analytic Geometry
- Chapter 4: Matrix Decompositions
- Chapter 5: Vector Calculus
- Chapter 6: Probability and Distributions
- Chapter 7: Continuous Optimization

The repository will (also eventually) likely contain supplementary code for Part II (Central Machine Learning Problems). However, as there are no formal exercises, the code will be scattered.
