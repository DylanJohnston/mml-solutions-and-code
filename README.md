# Mathematics for Machine Learning - Solutions to Exercises
My personal handwritten solutions to exercises in the book "Mathematics for Machine Learning" by  Deisenroth, Faisal, and Ong. 

A link to the book (it is freely available): https://mml-book.com

My solutions will inevitably contain some mistakes. I apologise for this, and I can only hope they are only minor and do not cause too much confusion.

## Contents of repository 

A PDF file containing scanned solutions for the exercises for each chapter from Part I (Mathematical Foundations). The chapters are as follows:
- Chapter 2: Linear Algebra
- Chapter 3: Analytic Geometry
- Chapter 4: Matrix Decompositions
- Chapter 5: Vector Calculus
- Chapter 6: Probability and Distributions
- Chapter 7: Continuous Optimization

There is also helper code for Chapter 6, specifically Exercise 6.2, where the means, modes and medians of certain Gaussian mixtures need to be computed numerically.

The repository will (eventually) likely contain supplementary code for Part II (Central Machine Learning Problems). However, as there are no explicit exercises in this part, the code will be scattered.
